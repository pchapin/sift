SIFT TODO List
==============

+ Enhance the documentation by adding comments to the package specifications. This will help the
  GNAT documentation tool produce more useful documentation (I think).

+ Generalize the existing tool so that it can use a lattice of security values.

+ Generalize the existing tool so that it can be used for both confidentiality and integrity
  analysis.

+ Enhance the supporting graph handling packages in Spica

+ Consider adding some unit tests.

+ Begin removing the tool's many restrictions. It probably makes sense to do this in a way that
  plays well with Ada's pragma Restrictions feature. For example, a first step might be bring
  the tool to a place where it can be used with the SPARK subset of Ada. Then add support for
  features that correspond to the removal of explicit restrictions on SPARK. This approach would
  make the tool useful early (for example on SPARK programs) without requiring it to deal with
  the complexity of full Ada.
