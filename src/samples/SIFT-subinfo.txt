# SIFT-subinfo.txt
#
# This file contains subprogram information provided by the programmer.
# SIFT reads this file and uses it to initialize its internal subprogram
# database.
#
# Each non-comment, non-blank line provides information about one sub-
# program. The fully qualified name of the subprogram is first on the
# line (currently no leading spaces are allowed), immediately followed
# by a ':'. Following the ':' one or more classification codes must
# appear.
#
# 'O' : Output subprogram. It is an error to send Tainted data to such
#       a subprogram.
#
# 'I' : Input subprogram. Any values returned by this subprogram are
#       tainted regardless of the inputs.
#
# 'S' : Sanitizing subprogram. Any values returned by this subprogram are
#       NOT tainted regardless of the inputs.
#
# 'P' : Passive subprogram. If any input to this subprogram is tainted
#       all the outputs are tainted; otherwise the outputs are NOT
#       tainted.
#
# The I, S, and P classifications are mutually exclusive. The O class-
# ification can be applied to any of the other subprogram types.
# Subprograms not listed here are taken as passive by default. Operators,
# both built-in and user defined, are treated uniformly. For example
# Standard."+" refers to function "+" in package Standard.
#
# Overloaded subprogram names are treated identically. That is, all
# subprogrms with the same name will get the same classification. This
# is not ideal, but it represents a limitation with the current version
# of ATC and not on the analysis technique ATC uses.

Get: I
Put: O
Clean: S
